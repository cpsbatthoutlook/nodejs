K8-DNS has 3 components: kube-dns, sidecar {4 healthchk}, dnsmasq

# DNS POD https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/  
    A  . Normal svc, 
        with ClusterIP resolves to it
        without ClusterIP resolves to POD IPs
    SRV . for ? names ports ?
        Resolves to Domain name & ports 
        for headless {no ClusterIP}  resolves to each pod {contains domain port}
    POD  resolves to metadata. but with right metadata it would be {hostname: foo, subdmain: bar, ns = my-namespace, cluster-domain.example}
       with is foo.bar.namespace.cluster-domain.example

Pods DNS policy :  Default {Local Node }, ClusterFirst {}, ClusterFirstWithHostNet

#Check DNS configuration & Svc is up
nslookup kubernetes.default

#Check if DNS pod is running, usually two running on master
kc get pods,svc,deploy -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns

#Are DNS endpoints exposed
kc ge ep kube-dns -n kube-system

#Check errors in the pod  {E Error, W Warning, F Failure}
## Append the logging level
 kc -n kube-system edit cm coredns  ## Add log before errors
