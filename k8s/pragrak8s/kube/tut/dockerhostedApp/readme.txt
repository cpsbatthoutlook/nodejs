#Test
 for a in node1 node2 master;do curl -i  --connect-timeout 5 ${a}:30385; done
p=30385  #Svc

Issues:
With single replica, nodeport:svcPort works on the pod running on that Node.
with 2 replicas, on each node,  nodeport:svcPort not working. (Application is running on NodePort)

With LoadBalancer, it runs on each port.
